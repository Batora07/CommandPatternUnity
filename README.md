# CommandPatternUnity
Implementation of a command pattern simple project in Unity (made thanks to the awesome tutorials from Board to Bits Games YT channel)

Use Mouse Button to instantiate a cube.
Use "Z" key to undo.
Use "R" key to redo.

If you change the history while you're undoing something, the R key won't do anything since you created a new path (yes I look at you Avengers Endgame).
